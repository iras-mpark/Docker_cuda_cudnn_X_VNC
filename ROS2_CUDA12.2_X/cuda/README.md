# A Directory for CUDA 12.2 Runfile

Let's say you want to use CUDA version 12.2.2_535.104.05, put the file "cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run" in this directory.


wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.2.2/local_installers/cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run

(refer: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-2-2-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=runfile_local)

Note: you might need to revise the Dockerfile for the filename changes.
